1) Move  HudsUp.JPG to downloads
2) Open HudTest.py and change the line "image_file = 'C:/users/XXXX/Downloads/HudsUp.jpg'" replacing XXXX with your username on the machine
3) Shift + Right click and select "Open Command Line Window  here" or "Powershell Window here"
4) With the new  window open, type and run "python .\HudTest.py". As long as you're where the script is, it  will just run.
5) Any errors will most  likely be related to it not being able to find the HudsUp image. Double Check its location.
